# Case Studies Version 1

This repository contains the first version of the brake case study V-SUM containing the following two meta-models:

- CAD Meta-Model (see https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/sfb1608/case-studies/brake-case-study/-/wikis/CAD-Meta-model)

- Brake specification model (see https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/sfb1608/case-studies/brake-case-study/-/wikis/Brake-Specification-Meta-model)


Additionally the semantic overlap between the two meta-models is deocumented (see https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/sfb1608/case-studies/brake-case-study/-/wikis/Semantic-Overlaps-Brake-System-CAD).
